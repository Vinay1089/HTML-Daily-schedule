        <h1> Day Trading </h1>
        <p> 
            Day trading usually refers to the practice of purchasing and selling a security 
            within a single trading day. While it can occur in any marketplace, it is most 
            common in the foreign exchange (forex) and stock markets. Day traders are typically 
            well-educated and well-funded. They use high amounts of leverage and short-term 
            trading strategies to capitalize on small price movements that occur in highly 
            liquid stocks or currencies.
